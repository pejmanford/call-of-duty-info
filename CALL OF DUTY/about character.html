                    <hr class="hr1">
					<p class="content">in Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, Captain Price serves as the commanding officer of primary protagonist John "Soap" MacTavish. He is also the player character for two flashback missions set in Pripyat in 1996, these being "All Ghillied Up" and "One Shot One Kill". The missions explore an assassination attempt on main antagonist Imran Zakhaev. At the conclusion of the game, he is severely wounded in a tanker truck explosion, but passes an M1911 pistol to Soap so he can kill Zakhaev.

Price survives this incident, and is encountered again in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. He is discovered imprisoned by terrorist Vladimir Makarov after an attempt to capture him gone awry, and joins Task Force 141 in an attempt to stop a war between the United States and Russia. However, Task Force 141 is betrayed by their commanding officer, General Shepherd, who orchestrated the war in order to raise American patriotism and become a war hero. Price and Soap embark on a suicide mission to kill Shepherd and avenge their comrades; they succeed in doing so, although Task Force 141 is disavowed and they are labelled terrorists.
<br>
In Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, Price and Soap ally with Yuri, an ex-Spetsnaz operative, and Team Metal, a Delta Force fireteam, to kill Makarov and clear their names. During an assassination attempt in Prague, Makarov reveals he has a history with Yuri and kills Soap. Price learns that Yuri was formerly an associate of Makarov, but betrayed him during a terrorist attack on a civilian airport. The two work with Team Metal to rescue the Russian president and his daughter from Makarov, ending the war and clearing their names; Team Metal is killed in the battle. Several months later, Price and Yuri launch an assault on a hotel owned by Makarov and finally kill him at the cost of Yuri's life

                    <hr class="hr1">
					<p class="content">In Call of Duty: Modern Warfare (2019), Captain Price returns to the campaign, which takes place in a new timeline.[10] He is portrayed by actor Barry Sloane.[11]
<br>
Price is contacted by CIA agent Kate Laswell about the Russian nerve gas crisis. Given its threat status, he agreed to finish this operation. When London was attacked by Al-Qatala Price leads his Bravo team to contain the situation. Then, after a raid on a Al-Qatala terror cell in townhouse, intelligence shown the leader' name: Omar "The Wolf" Sulaiman. After the crisis ends and Barkov disowned by Russia for his action, Price meets up with Laswell to discuss the formation of Task Force 141, with few names up for consideration: his subordinate, Kyle "Gaz" Garrick, John "Soap" MacTavish, and Simon "Ghost" Riley.[12]
<br>
In Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II, the sequel to the reboot, Price plays a semi-major role in the campaign. In order to pursue Hassan Zyani, a Quds Force Major and the new leader of Al-Qatala, they pursue one of his couriers in Amsterdam, revealing it to be the Las Almas Cartel. Price, Gaz and Laswell then go to Spain after tracing Hassan's phone to a Las Almas owned fishing hatchery, where Laswell is captured by Al-Qatala. Price, Gaz and Farah and Nikolai from the previous game return to Urzikstan to retrieve Laswell. After Soap, Ghost and Alejandro Vargas, a Mexican Special Forces operative, are betrayed by General Shephard and Shadow Company, Price and Gaz assault the prison and rescue them, and launch an assault to reclaim their base. Price, Soap, Gaz, Ghost and Laswell then head to Chicago to stop Hassan from launching a captured ballistic missile at Washington D.C, where he and Soap is injured. Soap and Ghost eventually kill Hassan, and in a post-credits scene, Laswell informs Price, Soap, Ghost and Gaz about a Russian Ultranationalist known as Vladimir Makarov.

                    <hr class="hr1">
					<p class="content">
						For those keen to know more, his full Modern Warfare 2 bio (screenshotted for me from the game by our Ishraq - thank you!) reads:<br>

"Johnny 'Soap' MacTavish is a fearless, self assured and instinctive hard-charger. Perpetually known as the FNG, a moniker born of hazing and ribbing that has become a badge of honour as he remains the youngest candidate to pass SAS selection in Royal Army history.
<br>
"He earned the nickname 'Soap' for cleaning house with remarkable speed and accuracy in room clearance techniques and urban warfare tactics. He is competitive, daring and always looking for a win."MacTavish was born in Scotland. His exact date and place of birth are undisclosed. A lifelong football fan and an extraordinary athlete in his own right, Johnny was a goalkeeper, tending the defensive position with a pronounced rapport with his teammates and an unyielding appetite for winning.<br>

"Johnny's cousin was a member of the 23 SAS Reserve Regiment and invited him to come up and see what it's like to be in the army. After his first visit, Johnny was hooked, visiting nearly every weekend. At 16, too young to sign up, but lying about his age, MacTavish enrolled in the Special Air Service."

                    <hr class="hr1">
					<p class="content">
his real name is simon riley.Simon Riley had a very traumatic childhood while growing up in Manchester, England because of his heartless father. On most days, his father brought dangerous animals back and taunted him with them, even going so far to force him to kiss a snake or threaten to kill him with them. When he and his younger brother Tommy got older, Tommy would always wear a skull-mask at night to scare Simon. Simon's father would sometimes take him to the Bone Lickers concerts. At one concert, his father made him laugh at the death of a prostitute who was addicted to drugs.Simon used to be an apprentice butcher at a grocery when he grew up. After the September 11 attacks occurred, he joined the military. He was an expert soldier which got him into the Special Air Service.Simon was pulled out from shipping out for an operation in Iran and was set to take the Zaragoza Drug Cartel down that was headed by Manuel Roba. When he and his team made their move on the Day of the Dead, the commanding officer, Major Vernon, betrayed them to the enemy by getting the three of them captured and brought to a torture and brainwashing facility. There, he was driven mad and tortured. At one point, he was buried alive and left by his captors. He used this opportunity to escape and got back home.

It took him four months to recover from all of that, but he was still having temper-management issues, and as a result he was not accepted back into the military. After having an episode with his former-colleague, Kevin Sparks, his entire family was killed by Sparks and Marcus Washington.

He killed Sparks and Washington and went after Roba once more. He ambushed Roba's right-hand man, Gilberto and tortured Roba's location out of him. He arrived at Roba's compound and stole all of the information on the company and killed Roba. Riley fought Roba's guards and burned his mansion and compound. When he left, he was approached by General Shepherd and recruited into Task Force 141 under the name of Ghost.
